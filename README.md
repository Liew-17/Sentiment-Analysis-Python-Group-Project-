# Sentiment Analysis Python Group Project


## 1. Overview  
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on Twitter posts containing the hashtag **#CovidVaccine**.  
The main goal is to analyze public opinion toward Covid-19 vaccination by processing tweets, cleaning the text, and applying sentiment classification.  
The project also generates visualizations to highlight sentiment distribution and trends over time.  


## 2. Project Structure  

The repository is organized into three main folders:  

- **`src/`**  
  Contains all Python `.py` modular files.  
  These modules can be imported to access reusable functions or to run the complete sentiment analysis pipeline.  

- **`notebook/`**  
  Includes `python_project.ipynb`, a Jupyter Notebook that combines both code and explanatory markdown.  
  - Serves as a step-by-step guide to understand how the `.py` files are generated.  
  - Can be executed directly to reproduce the sentiment analysis and obtain results.  

- **`output/`**  
  Stores generated results, including:  
  - `processed_data.csv`: The cleaned and processed dataset with sentiment labels.  
  - Visualizations:  
    - **Pie chart** showing the distribution of sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral).  
    - **Line chart** illustrating sentiment trends over time.
